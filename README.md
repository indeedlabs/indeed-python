# indeed-python

A client library for using the Indeed Jobsearch API

## Installation

Install from PyPi using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/), a
package manager for Python.

    $ pip install indeed

Don't have pip installed? Try installing it, by running this from the command
line:

    $ curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python

## API Credentials

The Indeed API needs to be called with your Indeed publisher number. You must pass this
to the `IndeedClient` constructor.

```python
from indeed import IndeedClient

client = IndeedClient(publisher=YOUR_PUBLISHER_NUMBER)
```

If you do not have a publisher number, you can receive one by heading to the
[Indeed Publisher Portal](https://ads.indeed.com/jobroll/xmlfeed).


## Performing a Job Search

```python
from indeed import IndeedClient

client = IndeedClient('YOUR_PUBLISHER_NUMBER')

params = {
    'q': "python",
    'l': "austin",
    'userip': "1.2.3.4",
    'useragent': "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2)"
}

search_response = client.search(**params)
```

## Retrieving Job Details

```python
from indeed import IndeedClient

client = IndeedClient('YOUR_PUBLISHER_NUMBER')

job_response = client.jobs(jobkeys=("5898e9d8f5c0593f", "c2c41f024581eae5"))
